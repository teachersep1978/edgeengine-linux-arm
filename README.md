# edgeEngine for Linux on ARM

## edgeEngine for Linux ARM Platform 

For those who are new to edgeEngine, we recommend reading about the overall capabilities of this product [here](https://devdocs.mimik.com/introduction)


Please also be advised that different versions of edgeEngine are available for different CPU architectures and OS platforms. Please see [here](https://github.com/edgeEngine)

The edgeEngine 3.0.x Runtime for ARM CPU architecture is a new generation of edgeEngine with a new set of features and capabilities as described in the followings:

 - Supporting WebAssembly serverless microservice runtime environment.
 - Supporting wasi_snapshot_preview1 in WebAssembly serverless microservice runtime environment
 - Supporting Prometheus metrics endpoint. (observability)

 Besides the above-mentioned new features, we also improved the following existing features as described below:
 - Global discovery
 - Feedbacks for API errors
 - Response time in JavaScript serverless microservice runtime environment enabling a serverless environment for different cores of ARM CPU.
 
 By using existing and the new edgeEngine's capabilities, embedded platform developers will be able to: 
 
 - Develop Multi-thread programs across all cores.
 - Dynamically configure microservices.
 - Reuse the microservices code across different platforms.
 - Use RESTful API to communicate with microservices across the CPU cores and across the PCBs.
 - Use a uniform deployment mechanism across all CPU cores and across different PCBs.
 - Dynamically update microservices across the cores, platforms, and PCBs.
 - Dynamically deploy microservices across all platforms and PCBs, using the "Control node" and "Worker node" model.
 - Make the File system available for all microservices, even for those which are running on restricted cores (i.e., R5F cores on TI-TDA4VM).
 - From microservice mesh across CPU cores, platforms, or PCBs.
 - Enable microservice-to-microservice communication running on CPU cores or between PCBs.
 - RESTful API instead of RPC API on restricted ARM cortex (i.e., R5F)

## Documentation 

<details><summary> Installation Guide </summary>
<p>
 
1. Download the latest release for Ubuntu [HERE](https://github.com/edgeEngine/edgeengine-linux/releases)
 
2. Create a new directory
 
3. Move the package to newly a created directory 
 
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the newly created directory that now has the downloaded .tar file
 
5. *Untar package (ex:)
 
```
tar xvf edge-linux-v3.0.0.tar
```
6. Run start script to start edgeEngine
```
./start.sh
```
7. Please visit https://developer.mimik.com and create your account and access the resources

<details><summary> Note: </summary>
<p>



* A directory may be made after untaring. Navigate into that directory to find `start.sh` script 
- Do not close the terminal window where edgeEngine is running. Closing this window will terminate edgeEngine process.
- To stop edgeEngine, simply close or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + C in the terminal window where edgeEngine is running "Hello World."
